      <description>Each and every problem in machine learning and deep learning requires evaluation of outcomes which differentiates a good model from a bad model. What I mean is that we need to define the ways to evaluate the model goodness - Model Evaluation.
What&amp;rsquo;s the need of evaluation? Before shipping out the trained model its imperative to evaluate how well model will perform on the data which it will see for the first time.</description>

      <description>Computer Vision Pipeline Input Data &amp;gt; Preprocessing &amp;gt; Selection of Area of Interest &amp;gt; Feature Extraction &amp;gt; Predection/Recognition 1. Input Data Input data is the images
2. Preprocessing Preprocessing is done to make computation faster and remove unnecessary items from the image. Like removing noise, Correcting images and removind unnecessary traits. Sharpening the image, scaling. Most importantly its also used to enhance the most important parts of the image.</description>

      <description>My curiosity of understanding pixels better made me plot the color channels of an RGB image separately. I was not in pursuit of any hi-fi results but just 3 plots of Red, Green, Blue channels separately. To accomplish this all I needed was slicing and chopping of Numpy arrays. In starting, I was only looking for a simple way to achieve this - but found 3 ways, each little different in terms of numpy function used.</description>

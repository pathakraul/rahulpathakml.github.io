      <description>Each and every problem in machine learning and deep learning requires evaluation of outcomes which differentiates a good model from a bad model. What I mean is that we need to define the ways to evaluate the model goodness - Model Evaluation.
What&amp;rsquo;s the need of evaluation? Before shipping out the trained model its imperative to evaluate how well model will perform on the data which it will see for the first time.</description>

      <description>My curiosity of understanding pixels better made me plot the color channels of an RGB image separately. I was not in pursuit of any hi-fi results but just 3 plots of Red, Green, Blue channels separately. To accomplish this all I needed was slicing and chopping of Numpy arrays. In starting, I was only looking for a simple way to achieve this - but found 3 ways, each little different in terms of numpy function used.</description>
